Firstly rinse baingan with water and pat dry. Keep the stem as with the help of the stem you can turn the brinjal.
Then give a cross slit from the bottom and check for worms. Now you can roast the brinjal in open flame.
Keep flame to medium or medium-low. Take care while turning the brinjal. Hold the stem and turn.
Turn the brinjal after every 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenly cooked.
If you are not able to hold the stem as its too hot or the heat from the fire is much, then using tongs turn over. Be careful when roasting brinjal.
Spread some oil on the brinjal before roasting. You can even skip this step.
Alternatively, a few garlic cloves can be embedded in the brinjal before roasting.
